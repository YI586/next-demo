## Description

Create drag and drop system that allows users to move selected elements around
the canvas with smooth visual feedback and proper collision detection

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Selected elements can be dragged with mouse,Multiple selected elements
      move together,Visual feedback shows element positions during drag,Drop
      operation updates element positions in store,Drag operation respects
      canvas boundaries and viewport
- [ ] #2 Elements can be dragged smoothly with mouse and touch input,Drag
      operations update element positions in real-time,Multiple selected
      elements move together during drag,Drag performance is smooth without lag
      or jitter,QA testing validates drag functionality works correctly across
      different devices and interaction scenarios
- [ ] #3 Elements can be dragged to new positions smoothly,Multi-selected
    elements move together as a group,Drag operations provide visual feedback
    during movement,Drag constraints prevent elements from moving outside
    reasonable bounds,System updates element positions in diagram store
    correctly,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after
    implementation
