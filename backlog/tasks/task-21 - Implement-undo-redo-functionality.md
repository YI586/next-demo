## Description

Create undo/redo system that tracks state changes and allows users to reverse
and reapply operations using keyboard shortcuts and UI controls

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Undo reverts the last diagram operation,Redo reapplies previously
      undone operations,Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y work
      correctly,Undo/redo buttons in UI reflect available operations,State
      snapshots are managed efficiently for performance
- [ ] #2 Undo functionality reverses the last diagram modification,Redo
      functionality restores previously undone changes,Undo/redo stack maintains
      reasonable memory limits,Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y) work
      correctly,QA testing validates undo/redo functionality works correctly for
      all types of diagram modifications
- [ ] #3 Undo functionality (Ctrl+Z) reverses the last action,Redo functionality
    (Ctrl+Y) restores undone actions,System maintains history stack of diagram
    state snapshots,History stack has reasonable size limits to prevent memory
    issues,Undo/redo works for all major operations (create, move, delete,
    edit),QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
