## Description

Implement viewport management for infinite canvas including coordinate transformations, pan/zoom functionality, and world-to-screen coordinate conversions

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Viewport state tracks pan position and zoom level,World coordinates are converted to screen coordinates,Screen coordinates are converted to world coordinates,Zoom operations maintain center point focus,Pan operations update viewport position correctly
- [ ] #2 Viewport system manages pan and zoom transformations,Coordinate conversion between screen and canvas coordinates works correctly,Viewport bounds and infinite canvas behavior are implemented,Zoom limits and smooth zoom transitions are functional,QA testing validates viewport operations work smoothly across different devices and input methods
- [ ] #3 Viewport system manages canvas position and zoom level,System provides smooth pan and zoom interactions,Coordinate transformations between screen and canvas space work correctly,Viewport bounds are properly managed for infinite canvas,System integrates with diagram store for state persistence,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
