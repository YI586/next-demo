## Description

Define the abstract StorageAdapter interface that provides a contract for different storage implementations, enabling extensibility for future storage options

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 StorageAdapter interface is properly defined,Interface includes save and load methods,Type-safe contracts for diagram serialization,Interface supports async operations,Documentation for implementing adapters is included
- [ ] #2 Abstract StorageAdapter interface is defined with save/load methods,Interface supports extensibility for different storage backends,Type definitions include proper error handling,Interface is well-documented with clear method signatures,QA testing validates interface design supports future storage implementations
- [ ] #3 Abstract StorageAdapter interface is defined with save and load methods,Interface supports extensibility for different storage backends,Type definitions are comprehensive and well-documented,Interface design follows SOLID principles,Implementation enables future storage options (database, API, local storage),QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
