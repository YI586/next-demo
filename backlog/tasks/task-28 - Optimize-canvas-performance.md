## Description

Implement performance optimizations including viewport culling, efficient rendering, and debounced operations for smooth user experience with large diagrams

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Only elements in viewport are rendered for performance,Drag operations are debounced to prevent excessive updates,Canvas redraws are minimized and optimized,Memory usage remains stable with large diagrams,Frame rate stays smooth during intensive operations
- [ ] #2 Canvas rendering is optimized for smooth performance with many elements,Element virtualization is implemented for large diagrams,Event handling is optimized to prevent performance bottlenecks,Memory usage remains reasonable during extended use,QA testing validates performance meets requirements under various load conditions
- [ ] #3 Canvas performance is optimized for large numbers of elements,Only visible elements are rendered (viewport culling),Drag operations are smooth without visual lag,Memory usage remains stable during extended use,Performance optimizations don't compromise functionality,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
