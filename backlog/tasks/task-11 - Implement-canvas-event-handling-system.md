## Description

Create a robust event handling system for canvas interactions including mouse,
touch, and keyboard events with proper event delegation and coordinate
transformation

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Mouse events are captured and processed correctly,Touch events work for
      mobile/tablet devices,Keyboard events are handled for accessibility,Event
      coordinates are transformed to world space,Event delegation prevents
      performance issues with many elements
- [ ] #2 Mouse and touch event handlers are implemented for canvas
      interactions,Event delegation is set up at canvas level for
      performance,Event coordinates are properly transformed to canvas
      coordinates,Events are captured for click, drag, double-click, and key
      interactions,QA testing validates event handling works correctly across
      different input devices and browsers
- [ ] #3 Event handling system captures mouse and touch events on canvas,System
    delegates events to appropriate handlers based on target,Click detection
    differentiates between canvas and element clicks,Drag operations are
    properly detected and managed,Event system prevents conflicts between
    different interaction modes,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester
    after implementation
