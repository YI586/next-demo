## Description

Implement the user interaction flow for creating connectors between sticky notes by dragging from connection points

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 User can drag from sticky note edge to create connector,Visual feedback shows connector being drawn during drag,Connector snaps to valid connection points on target,Invalid drop locations cancel connector creation,Created connectors are properly stored and rendered
- [ ] #2 Connector tool allows creation of lines between sticky notes,Drag from connection point to another note creates connector,Visual feedback shows connection possibilities during drag,Created connectors are properly stored in diagram state,QA testing validates connector creation workflow is intuitive and works correctly
- [ ] #3 Dragging from connection point starts connector creation mode,Visual feedback shows connector being drawn to mouse position,Dropping on another element's connection point creates connector,Invalid drop targets are indicated and prevent connection creation,Connector creation integrates with diagram store and undo system,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
