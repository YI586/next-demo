## Description

Integrate all canvas systems into a unified CanvasEngine component that manages rendering, interactions, and coordinates between all subsystems

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CanvasEngine component renders all diagram elements,Mouse and keyboard interactions work seamlessly,Viewport management integrates with rendering system,Element operations update canvas in real-time,Performance is optimized for smooth user experience
- [ ] #2 Main canvas engine integrates all canvas subsystems correctly,Canvas component renders and updates efficiently,All user interactions work through the unified canvas interface,Canvas engine handles complex interaction scenarios properly,QA testing validates the complete canvas functionality works as an integrated system
- [ ] #3 Canvas engine integrates all canvas systems (viewport, events, rendering),Component manages canvas lifecycle and updates,Engine coordinates between user interactions and state changes,Performance is optimized for smooth real-time interactions,Component handles canvas resizing and responsive behavior,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
