## Description

Create comprehensive type definitions for all diagram elements, canvas
operations, and application state to ensure type safety throughout the
application

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Element types for StickyNote and Connector are defined,Canvas
      coordinate and viewport types are created,Store state interfaces are
      properly typed,Storage adapter interfaces are defined,All types export
      correctly and can be imported
- [ ] #2 Element interfaces (StickyNote, Connector) are defined in
      src/types/elements.ts,Diagram and UI state types are defined,Canvas
      interaction types are properly structured,All interfaces are exported and
      importable,QA testing validates type definitions work correctly in IDE and
      compilation
- [ ] #3 Core TypeScript interfaces are defined in src/types/ directory,Element
    types (StickyNote, Connector) are properly typed,Diagram and UI state
    interfaces are defined,Storage adapter interfaces are created,All types
    compile without errors and provide proper IntelliSense,QA validation
    required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
