## Description

Create the Connector component for drawing lines between sticky notes with arrow heads, connection points, and proper routing logic

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Connectors render as lines between two points,Arrow heads are drawn at connection endpoints,Connection points on sticky notes are identified,Connectors update when connected elements move,Line routing avoids overlapping with elements where possible
- [ ] #2 Connector component draws lines between sticky notes with arrow heads,Connectors automatically update when connected notes are moved,Connection points are visually indicated on sticky notes,Line styling (color, width) is configurable,QA testing validates connector creation and behavior work correctly with note movement
- [ ] #3 Connector element draws lines between sticky notes,Connector displays arrow heads to indicate direction,Element supports different connection points (top, right, bottom, left),Connector updates automatically when connected elements move,Element provides visual feedback during creation process,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
