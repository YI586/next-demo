## Description

Implement React error boundaries to gracefully handle errors and provide user-friendly error recovery options throughout the application

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully,Users receive helpful error messages with recovery options,Application state can be reset after errors,Error boundaries don't interfere with normal operation,Development and production error handling differs appropriately
- [ ] #2 Error boundaries catch and handle React component errors gracefully,Application provides meaningful error messages to users,Error recovery allows users to continue working after non-critical errors,Error logging provides useful debugging information,QA testing validates error handling works correctly for various error scenarios
- [ ] #3 Error boundaries catch and handle React component errors gracefully,Application provides meaningful error messages to users,Error states don't cause complete application failure,Logging captures errors for debugging purposes,Recovery mechanisms allow users to continue working when possible,QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after implementation
