## Description

Implement the core canvas rendering system that draws elements, handles render
loops, and manages canvas context efficiently for optimal performance

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->

- [ ] #1 Canvas context is properly managed and initialized,Elements are
      rendered correctly on canvas,Render loop handles updates efficiently,Only
      visible elements are rendered for performance,Canvas clears and redraws
      properly on state changes
- [ ] #2 Canvas rendering engine draws all diagram elements correctly,Rendering
      is optimized to only redraw changed elements,High-DPI displays are
      supported with proper scaling,Frame rate remains smooth during
      interactions,QA testing validates rendering performance and visual quality
      across different screen resolutions
- [ ] #3 Rendering engine draws all diagram elements on HTML5 Canvas,Engine
    renders only elements visible in current viewport,Rendering performance is
    optimized for smooth interactions,Visual elements (sticky notes, connectors)
    are rendered correctly,Engine supports different element states (normal,
    selected, hover),QA validation required by @playwright-qa-tester after
    implementation
